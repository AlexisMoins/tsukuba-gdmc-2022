#
# More explanations on the types
#
# - random (RandomPalette) : Will give bloc in a random sequence from the given list or dictionary, if a list is given,
# all blocs will have equal chances, if a dictionary with values is given, values will be used as weights
#
# - sequence (RandomSequencePalette) : Will give bloc following a sequence from the shuffled given list
#
# - one_color (OneBlockPalette) : Will make a list of all color + replaced_by attribute like so : <color><replaced_by>
# and only save one item of the list to give each time
# example : replaced_by: _banana => will choose one item from [ white_banana, pink_banana, orange_banana, etc ...]

#
# ALIASES
#
# You can use alias to define a type that regroups multiples palettes :
# - &<name> to create an alias
# - <<: *<name> to use it
#
# example :
# some_dirt: *dirt
#   dirt:
#     type: random
#     replaced_by: [ dirt, podzol, coarse_dirt ]
#
# some_stone: *stone
#   stone:
#     type: random
#     replaced_by: [ stone, cobblestone, stone_bricks ]
#
# default_variations:
#   <<: *dirt
#   <<: *stone
#
# And you can even set an alias for default_variations and go on!
